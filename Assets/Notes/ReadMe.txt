Make sure to purchase this package before any release of this project and update the shader to support URP (I chaged the 6-Layer shader to support URP. Use Amplify shader editor to edit them): https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/hdrp-terrain-tessellation-shader-191250

To create the tessellation, we need to make sure that we add an alpha channel on the main texture, paste the texture's normal map and greyscale it.
